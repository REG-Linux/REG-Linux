		<name>Dottie Flowers</name>
		<desc>A charming platformer game created as a tribute to the fantastic SNES community and an homage to the German 16-bit video game developers of the early nineties. In this game, players step into the shoes - or rather, fly on the broom - of a witch named Dottie Flowers. Dottie has the critical task of saving her city using her magical powers and trusty broom.</desc>

		<path>./Super Boss Gaiden (v1.2).sfc</path>
		<name>Super Boss Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Humorous beat'em up game, where the fictional President of a video game company gets angry when his executives deliver the news that the last remaining prototype has fallen into the hands of the general public and has been emulated. Being a very hands-on executive, instead of calmly discussing the situation and planning out the proper legal counter action, the titular Boss takes on employees and resources with both fists and feet.</desc>
