		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide the amoeba (a single-celled creature) up a never-ending series of platforms without falling. The higher you get, the higher your score will be.
There are three different platform types:
Yellow - these are the basic, stable platforms
White - these are unstable platforms that disappear after you bounce off them once
Blue - these platforms are harder to hit because they move back and forth horizontally
Jumping on a red or green spring-button will give you a short boost and some bonus points, but best of all: it makes the little amoeba rejoice!
When your score gets beyond 1000 points, little oval-shaped bacteria start appearing on the platforms, which can be eaten by the amoeba. Each bacteria holds one of the six letters from the word A-M-O-E-B-A. Collect all six and the single next time you jump on a spring, you will get a super long boost.</desc>
