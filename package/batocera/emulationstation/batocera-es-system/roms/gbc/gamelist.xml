		<desc>Build your favorite pets in all shapes and sizes, keep ahead of dropping pieces and make it to the next level.

There are several game play types to choose from:

- Long Pet - Complete progressively longer pets to reach the next level
- Tails Cleanup - Clear all tails off the screen per level
- Crunch-up - Keep ahead as the screen crunches upward and new pets appear
- Level Up - Classic level-up style
-  Marathon - For the long distance player

Difficulty levels for all players.

Oh, and if you drop this rom in "gbc2players", you can play 2-player link mode (crunch-up recommended).</desc>
