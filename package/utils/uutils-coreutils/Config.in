	  uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the
	  GNU coreutils in Rust.

	  While all programs have been implemented, some options might
	  be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

	help
	  Build coreutils as a single multi-call binary, or as a set
	  of separate utilities.

	  Select 'y' to build coreutils as a single ‘coreutils’ binary.
	  This approach allows to reduce overhead and achieve a minimal
	  image size.

	  Select 'n' to build coreutils as a collection of independent
	  binaries, such as 'cp, mv, df, ...'. This approach produces
	  larger final image, but it manages each application
	  individually.

	  It often comes in handy for testing, as it allows you to
	  replace several specific binaries and see what happens.

config BR2_PACKAGE_UUTILS_COREUTILS_UTILITIES
	string "utilities"
	default "default"
	help
	  This option specifies precisely which utilities will be
	  built.

	  Use 'default' to build all available utilities.

	  Use a space-separated list of utilities, such as 'cp mv df’,
	  to explicitly specify the utilities to build.
