        I installed REG Linux on a USB using Etcher.
        I plugged the USB into my laptops USB port.
        The I booted my PC and changed the BIOS boot order to boot off the USB.
        When REG Linux attempts to boot I see a resizing screen with a progess bar.
        The annother screen with a intro video.
        After that is goes blank.
        I heve no video or sound, just a balnk screen.
